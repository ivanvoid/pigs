# :pig: PIGS :pig:
Readme for PIGS or Pixelwise Image Graph Segmentation project developmet.

## Basic information
[Official PIGS repo](https://github.com/veax-void/pigs)

Fast package for image segmentatioin using graphs, like your dad use to make! 

## Problem to solve

Pixelwised image segmentation based on recurseve graph partitioning.  
I propose to use fast lib based on cpp code for image to graph trarnslation and graph segmentation.
